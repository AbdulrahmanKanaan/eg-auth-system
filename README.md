# EG Auth System

An authentication system that uses NestJS for the server side and ReactJS for the client

## Run it locally

to make it easy to run and test, I created a docker-compose file that'll do everything for you :)

so running the project for is as easy as running the following command inside the project directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AbdulrahmanKanaan/eg-auth-system.git
cd eg-auth-system
docker compose up
```

then go to <http://localhost>

## More info

for more info about the server or the client, you can check the README files inside the corresponding directory
